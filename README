python-libusb1 is a Python wrapper around libusb-1.0 [1].
It is not intended to preempt work done by pyusb[2] author, but as a quick way
to get a working wrapper with asynchronous transfer support. I actualy wasn't
aware that a libusb 1.0 wrapper was in the works (or was it when I started ?).
I don't plan, for example, to add support for multiple backends as next pyusb
version does.

It certainly has some rough edges, and I wield them out when they annoy me too
much.

libusb1.py
  Bare ctype wrapper, inspired from library C header file.
usb1.py
  Python-ish (classes, exceptions, ...) wrapper around libusb1.py .
