Pure-python wrapper for libusb-1.0

Supports all transfer types, both in synchronous and asynchronous mode.

Home: http://github.com/vpelletier/python-libusb1

PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/libusb1

Requirements
============

- Python_ 2.4+ required, 2.6+ recommended

  Python 3.x somewhat tested

  pypy_ somewhat tested, 1.9 has a `bug <https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1242>`_
  affecting python-libusb, which is fixed in their HG

- ctypes_ (included in Python 2.5+)

- libusb-1.0_

  libusbx should work, too

Compatibility
=============

python-libusb1 is expected to work on any OS supported by libusb. It can be
expected to work on:

- GNU/Linux

- Windows

  *not* libusb-win32 (this is libusb0.1, the old API)

- Cygwin

- OSX (macports, fink, homebrew)

  (beware of possible lack of select.poll support in python)

- FreeBSD

  libusb reimplementation: http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libusb/
  (including Debian GNU/kFreeBSD)

- OpenBSD

Contents
========

- libusb1.py

  Bare ctype wrapper, inspired from library C header file.

- usb1.py

  Python-ish (classes, exceptions, ...) wrapper around libusb1.py .
  See docstrings (pydoc recommended) for usage.

- setup.py

  To package as python egg.

- stdeb.cfg

  To package as Debian package. See https://github.com/astraw/stdeb .

- testUSB1.py

  Very limited regression test, only testing functions which do not require a
  USB device.

Install
=======

::

  python setup.py install

(you might need root access to do this)

History
=======

0.0.1
-----

Initial release

0.1.1
-----

Massive rework of usb1.py, making it more python-ish and fixing some
memory leaks.

0.1.2
-----

Deprecate "transfer" constructor parameter to allow instance reuse.

0.1.3
-----

Some work on isochronous "in" transfers. They don't raise exceptions anymore,
but data validity and python-induced latency impact weren't properly checked.

0.2.0
-----

Fix asynchronous configuration transfers.

Stand-alone polling thread for multi-threaded apps.

More libusb methods exposed on objects, including ones not yet part of
released libusb versions (up to their commit 4630fc2).

2to3 friendly.

Drop deprecated USBDevice.reprConfigurations method.

0.2.1
-----

Add FreeBSD support.

0.2.2
-----

Add Cygwin support.

OpenBSD support checked (no change).

0.2.3
-----

Add fink and homebrew support on OSX.

Drop PATH_MAX definition.

Try harder when looking for libusb.

1.0.0
-----

Fix FreeBSD ABI compatibility.

Easier to list connected devices.

Easier to terminate all async transfers for clean exit.

Fix few segfault causes.

pypy support.

1.1.0
-----

Descriptor walk API documented.

Version and capability APIs exposed.

Better Python 3 support.

Better exception handling in enumeration.

Add examples.
